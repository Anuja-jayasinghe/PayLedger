# PayLedger

Never miss a bill again. Simple, beautiful bill management that actually works.

Built from personal frustration with scattered bills and forgotten payments. PayLedger helps you track all your bills with their due dates, share with family, and understand your spending patterns without the overwhelming complexity.

## Features

- **Never Miss a Due Date**: Track all your bills with their due dates in a simple calendar view
- **Share with Family**: Share bills with your partner or family so everyone stays in the loop
- **See Your Patterns**: Understand where your money goes with simple analytics
- **Simple & Beautiful**: Clean interface that actually works without overwhelming complexity

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
